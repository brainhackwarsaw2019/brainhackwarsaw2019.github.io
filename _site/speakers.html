<p><strong>Bio:</strong>
Roberto Toro is a distinguished personality from open science movement with great knowledge on development and evolution of brain anatomy
He is currently leading a team of students (PhD, MSc) from interdisciplinary backgrounds. They develop computational neuroanatomy methods based on their theoretical models which they use to analyse the normal diversity of human brain anatomy, as well as to look for differences associated with neurodevelopmental pathologies. He is particularly interested in Autism Spectrum Disorders.</p>

<h4>Open mentoring</h4>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
One of the strongest movements in academia nowadays, is the Open Science movement. Its main postulates are: sharing access to high quality datasets with the general public and setting new standards for research reproducibility, e.g. by sharing codes and pipelines through open-access services such as GitHub. What else can and should we share in academia? Mentoring is one example of an asset which can also be shared between researchers all around the world. Today, it is no longer the case that mentoring experience can only be received from the direct supervisor; one can and should search out for advice from multiple researchers at every career stage, independently from geographical location - especially when there is little opportunity to be mentored in the local research environment.</p>

<p>Within the Organization for Human Brain Mapping Student and Postdoc Special Interest Group, we are interested in assisting early career researchers in accelerating their careers. One of our main initiatives is the International Online Mentoring Programme. Within the Programme, every member of the OHBM community worldwide can become either a mentor, a mentee or both. In this blitz talk, I will review the lessons we learned after over two years of running the programme, and recommendations we can give to young generation of researchers who are just entering their PhD.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong>
Natalia Bielczyk is now completing her thesis within the Donders Graduate School, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Nijmegen, the Netherlands. Her research concerns developing new methods for connectomics in the domain of cognitive neuroimaging, i.e. for functional and effective connectivity research. She also currently holds a position of a Career Development and Mentoring Manager within the Organization for Human Brain Mapping Student and Postdoc Special Interest Group (www.ohbmtrainees.com).</p>
