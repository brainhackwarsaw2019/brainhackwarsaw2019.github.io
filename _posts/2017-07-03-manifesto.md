# Manifesto

---

At Brainhack Warsaw we believe that creativity is a key factor of success. We think that science, programming and art are similar in their nature. Art doesn’t care about hierarchy. Nor we do. There are paths yet to be discovered and boundaries yet to be transgressed. Brainhack Warsaw is open for everyone. People from academia, artists, data scientists, physicists, biologists, poets, psychologists, females, males, religious, atheists. There’s only one thing that matters: creativity.


That’s why we chose yellow as our new color. Yellow is a color of creativity. We know that it takes a lot of courage to think differently. We do not choose the easy way. We do not follow old trajectories. That’s what we are. That’s how we look. Join us.



Sincerely yours, ❤️

Brainhack Warsaw 2019 Team
