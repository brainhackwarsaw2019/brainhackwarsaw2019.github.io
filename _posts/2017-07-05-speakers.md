#### Towards a collaborative neuroscience

**Abstract:**
Open Science is a recent movement aiming at giving researchers open access to datasets, tools, pipelines and publications. Science is no longer an ivory tower; it became more inclusive and transparent than ever before. How does research collaboration look like in times of open science? In this presentation, I will be talking about new tools that we are building to help researchers all around the globe work together. I will also relate to my daily research, including three main research lines in my group: brain development, evolution and Autism Spectrum Disorders.

**Bio:**
Roberto Toro graduated from a Master’s degree in Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Valparaiso, Chile (1997) and Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris (1998) and obtained a PhD from Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris (2003). Today, he is a Group Leader at the Institut Pasteur, Paris. Roberto is an expert in the domain of development and evolution of brain anatomy. In his research group, he utilizes mathematical modelling, Magnetic Resonance Imaging and human genetics. The team is oriented at developing computational neuroanatomy methods to analyse the normal diversity of human brain anatomy, and find differences associated with neurodevelopmental pathologies. Roberto is particularly interested in Autism Spectrum Disorders. Roberto is also highly engaged in the open science movement. He was a cofounder of the Brainhack community (Craddock et al., 2016) and he is an awardee of the Open Science Prize 2016 (worth 80k USD) for the BrainBox project. He is also currently a member of the OHBM Open Science Special Interest Group, and the Co-Chair of the OHBM Hackathon.

#### Open mentoring

**Abstract:**
One of the strongest movements in academia nowadays, is the Open Science movement. Its main postulates are: sharing access to high quality datasets with the general public and setting new standards for research reproducibility, e.g. by sharing codes and pipelines through open-access services such as GitHub. What else can and should we share in academia? Mentoring is one example of an asset which can also be shared between researchers all around the world. Today, it is no longer the case that mentoring experience can only be received from the direct supervisor; one can and should search out for advice from multiple researchers at every career stage, independently from geographical location - especially when there is little opportunity to be mentored in the local research environment.

Within the Organization for Human Brain Mapping Student and Postdoc Special Interest Group, we are interested in assisting early career researchers in accelerating their careers. One of our main initiatives is the International Online Mentoring Programme. Within the Programme, every member of the OHBM community worldwide can become either a mentor, a mentee or both. In this blitz talk, I will review the lessons we learned after over two years of running the programme, and recommendations we can give to young generation of researchers who are just entering their PhD.


**Bio:**
Natalia Bielczyk is now completing her thesis within the Donders Graduate School, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Nijmegen, the Netherlands. Her research concerns developing new methods for connectomics in the domain of cognitive neuroimaging, i.e. for functional and effective connectivity research. She also currently holds a position of a Career Development and Mentoring Manager within the Organization for Human Brain Mapping Student and Postdoc Special Interest Group (www.ohbmtrainees.com).

#### BrainBox

**Abstract:**
Progress in biomedical research requires studying datasets much larger than previously thought, but also finding ways for large numbers of researchers to collaborate creatively. In neuroimaging, a wealth of open data is available, including data on autism, schizophrenia, and many more. However, the data is not easy to find, is curated and analysed locally, in redundant, often wasteful and opaque ways.
Our Web application BrainBox explores a radical open science solution to the problem of distributed collaboration. A mix of Wikipedia and Google Docs, BrainBox enables researchers to add a layer of real-time interactive annotation and segmentation to the great amount of neuroimaging data shared online. It allows distributed research teams to collaborate in the analysis of open data and avoid redundant work – promoting community efforts instead of competition.
In my presentation, I will show you BrainBox in (inter)action, how to create a project, invite collaborators, annotate data, and use the API to integrate BrainBox into your automatic, reproducible analysis pipelines.
Currently, more than 13,000 datasets are indexed and available for collaboration. During the Brainhack, I will be more than happy to help you set up your own projects, or invite you to join my current project. By working together, sharing our work and our analyses, we should improve transparency, increase statistical power and reproducibility.


**Bio:**
I use neuroimaging to understand the evolution and development of the brain. I am strongly involved in open, reproducible, science and interdisciplinary research: I develop open Web applications to facilitate access to open data, foster collaboration and citizen science. I have a background in fine arts and in many of my projects I combine art and science ([http://tiny.cc/ArtOfMR_2X](http://tiny.cc/ArtOfMR_2X)) as a way to engage with the general public ([http://tiny.cc/FireAndWireX](http://tiny.cc/FireAndWireX)).
