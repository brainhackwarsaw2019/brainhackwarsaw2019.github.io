## Project 1: Misfolded protein spreading on brain connectome

## UNAVAILABLE

**Abstract**
Connectomics have been used so far to look for quantifying global and local differences in the functional or structural brain networks [1], or alternatively, to simulate/study brain hemodynamics [2] . Very few studies have used connectomes to investigate the spreading of misfolded proteins which is at the basis of Parkinson's (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) [3,4].
It is believed that diseases as AD and PD are spread by misfolded proteins or agents which moves along brain connections (axons and dendrides of the neurons) starting from specific regions to others [5]. For instance, AD has a progression of tau pathology consistently beginning in the entorhinal cortex, the locus coeruleus, and other nearby noradrenergic brainstem nuclei, before spreading to the rest of the limbic system as well as the cacingulate and retrosplenial cortices. While Parkinsons starts from the brainstem and spread to the neocortex [5].
A previous study investigated this mechanism on connectome comparing simulated tau deposits on connectome to those detected by PET scans specific for Alzheimer’s [3]. In this project, we aim at carrying out a similar study bu t for PD. In particular, we want to simulate deposits/spreading of alpha-syn proceeding via the brain’s anatomic connectivity network.
We will use human and mice data provided by the supervisors. The main challenge of the project is defining a proper model of spreading along the connectome. Data from the PPMI dataset ([https://www.ppmi-info.org/access-data-specimens/](https://www.ppmi-info.org/access-data-specimens/)) and given by the project supervisors will be given. Those include case (PD patients) and control subjects along with clinical data and genetics.

## Project 2: Generating fake MRI to enhance Alzheimer's disease prediction

### All places booked

**Abstract**
Alzheimer's disease (AD), a common form of dementia, occurs most frequently in aged population. More than 30 million people worldwide suffer from AD and, due to the increasing life expectancy, this number is expected to triple by 2050. Because of the dramatic increase in the prevalence of AD, the identification of effective biomarkers for the early diagnosis and treatment of AD in individuals at high risk to develop the disease is crucial. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage between age-related cognitive decline and AD, and the earliest clinically detectable stage of progression towards dementia or AD. Despite of many efforts, identifying efficient AD-specific biomarkers for the early diagnosis and prediction of disease progression is still challenging and requires more research. Neuroimaging based algorithms using structural T1 scans have been used to predict conversion from MCI to AD (Moradi, 2015) but there is still room for improvement.

A major problem in classification of Alzheimer's disease lies in the small datasets available. Hence, in this project our aim is to create synthetic/artificial T1 MRI scans and augment our dataset with the aim to further improve accuracy. Our workflow would involve a two-stage approach, whereby we would first generate fake MRI scans and secondly, we would add them to our existing real MRI scans and perform classification.

In terms of data augmentation techniques, Mixup (Zhang,2017) is a simple method which interpolates MRI scans originating from two different classes to obtain a new MRI scan with a fractional class label. Additionally, Generative Adversarial Networks (Goodfellow, 2014) have been successfully used to generate realistic pictures of celebrities or natural images with promising new developments in the realm of medical imaging (Wolterink, 2018).

Participants will be encouraged to develop their own classification pipeline, for example using Convolutional Neural Networks. Lastly, participants will be asked to consider ways of interpreting the predictions, to help better understand the neuroanatomical features involved in progression from MCI to AD.

## Project 3: Network analysis of the electrical activity of the brain during epileptic seizures

### All places booked

**Abstract:**
The recent development in Network Science had a significant impact on many fields of science. Networks proved to be suitable tools in describing a variety of complex systems, brain being one of them. So-called brain networks, based mainly on fMRI or EEG signals, were characterized by a non-trivial hierarchical structure [1]. Interestingly, it was shown that neurological and psychiatric disorders are often accompanied by significant changes in this characteristic structure [2].

Despite initial successes, there is still a number of bottlenecks in the brain networks analysis. In particular, how to properly estimate connections between different parts of the brain? More specifically, how to get rid of bias imposed by volume conduction or active reference electrode? This bias, that affects all signal simultaneously is often referred to as the problem of common sources. It is widely accepted that neuronal synchrony is a good measure of functional integrity in the brain. There are, however, many ways to estimate it. Recent results suggest that methods based on Phase Lag Index are well suited when using EEG data. They were shown to successfully diminish bias from common sources and give better results both for synthetic and real data [3].

Epilepsy is a highly prevalent disorder. 1% of all emergency department visits in USA are caused by epilepsy. In 2004 it resulted in around $ 17 billion of economic costs in Europe, 2 billion in India and $ 1 billion in USA. Yet the brain activity during seizures is still not well explained in the scientific literature. Its connection to brain electrical activity makes it natural to choose EEG as an experimental tool to collect the data suitable for diagnosis. In the project, we will provide with EEG datasets from patients with epilepsy and we will attempt to determine whether the brain network structure changes during epileptic seizures. In order to approach this question, we will use Phase Lag Index based measures. Finally, we would like to determine whether the network characteristics may be more successful in distinguishing or even predicting, different epileptic states, in comparison with classical indicators, such as the signal variance.

**Abstract:**
Convolutional neural networks are the state-of-the-art solution for image classification. They are able to recognize images at near-human (or occasionally: super-human) level. Their basic units are very different from the biological ones. Each layer is an array, for processing we use convolutions and matrix multiplications, and for gating - simple mathematical functions. Yet, the global architecture of local, hierarchical processing was inspired by mammalian visual cortex.

In this project we are going to explore which kind of information is being processed. We will try dissecting a network to see if a subset of network is able to recognize an image. We will try to see if different neural ImageNet architecture (e.g. VGG, ResNet, Inception, etc) “see” similar features.

And, in the absence of any ethics commission for artificial neural networks, we will cut two networks, sew them, and see is this frankensteinian model is able to recognize images.

**Abstract:**
The objective of the project is to propose the method for predicting fluid intelligence in children from the T1-weighted MRI images. Work will most likely consist of data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction and fitting a regression model.
First idea will be to apply methods like PCA for exploratory analysis and VAEs for nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Then we will use the space from VAEs to gaussian process regression and test different kernels. Of course, other approaches are also possible, depending on the preliminary results and the interest of the team.
If successful, the aim is to submit the method to the ABCD Neurocognitive Prediction Challenge which is hold in conjugation with MICCAI 2019 conference. Preprocessed data is provided by the challenge organisers (requires registration in advance). More details about the problem and the data are available at: [https://sibis.sri.com/abcd-np-challenge/](https://sibis.sri.com/abcd-np-challenge/).

**Abstract:**
In BCI, the environment is controlled by users through listening to active mental commands that need active effort and learning process. In this project, we are proposing a different paradigm where BCI algorithms listen to well-defined passive bottom-up processes like emotions and attention to choose/guess user preferred action. This approach is similar to [Flying Mollusk](https://www.flyingmollusk.com/) work but we are proposing its further development and more specific emotions indicators as a starting point.
We are providing
- 2 EEG setups with 2 channels (5 electrodes) and 1k Hz sampling
- Web service that:
1. Cleans signal and removes artifacts
2. Converts signal into emotions (BIS-BAS*) and attention indicators
3. Is integrated to the provided game for ease of work
- Short lecture about BIS-BAS
- Short lecture on signal quality and cleaning methods
- Introduction to the problem of multidimensionality and timescales, in the use of
emotions, for controlling (or assisting) games and devices
- Presentation of sample Python game reacting to emotions (cannon) and how to
use indicator e.g shooting on BAS
- Walk through Python game code [http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/freegames/](http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/freegames/)
- Help with development, expanding and optimizing parameters (The “problem of
multidimensionality and timescales”)
- Brains tournament in cannon between teams (if time permits)

## Project 7: Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis (cRQA) as a new measure of functional connectivity

### All places booked

**Abstract:**
The human brain organization might be characterized by two basic properties: the segregation and the integration (Friston, 1994). While the functional segregation describes specialization of the brain areas or networks, the functional integration provides an insight on how information between specialized areas/networks is integrated. This second property is frequently studied by observing brain connectivity patterns. In recent years, one type of connectivity namely functional connectivity has gained a great attention. In fact, actually this concept is not directly associated with biologically-rooted connections (for example, long-range white matter tracts) but rather with the similarity between time-series of BOLD, EEG or other neuroimaging signals. It follows logic: if signals from two brain areas are similar, these two brain regions are involved in processing similar information and thus, they are functionally connected. Most often, such functional connections are assessed with measures like the Pearson correlation. However, relatively smaller number of studies deal with measures directly associated with temporal structures in the data (e.g. mutual information etc.). In our project, we would like to develop a method introduced by Lombardi et al. (2017) for estimating functional connectivity patterns known from the Dynamical Systems Theory - cross Recurrence Quantification Analysis (cRQA). cRQA is a method which find application in analyzing coupling dynamical systems such as social interactions in dyads, interdependence of EEG signals etc. It allows presenting complex interactions in the simple form of a vector of measures describing state-switching properties of time-series. Following observations by Lombardi et al. (2017), we aim to compare obtained connectivity patterns defined by the cRQA with connectivity patterns obtained with the Pearson Correlation. We will use task-fMRI data from procedures testing different cognitive and emotional processes as well as resting-state fMRI data taken from the Human Connectome Project database.

**Abstract:**
The daily usage of our computers can become daunting at times: we spend our days slouched by the keyboard. What if we could create a method for controlling the computer using gestures?
The idea is to create a prototype for a wearable Human-Computer Interface (HCI) based on electromyography (EMG) signals. We will start off by gathering training data. Later through the use of Barachant's Minimum Distance to Mean (MDM) ([https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/681328/filename/Barachant_tbme_final.pdf](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/681328/filename/Barachant_tbme_final.pdf)) algorithm we will attempt to classify some simple gestures. This will be handled by a raspberry pi if possible. Finally, a client on a target remote computer will capture the determined gestures and map them into useful actions like opening the browser etc.

This will require certain tasks to be performed: gathering of learning data, creating a classification model, building a client app to map the classified action.

**Abstract:** Many active scientists use online social networks to share their research. Many of the ideas shaping modern science are disseminated this way. Online discussions between scientists precede and often shape what is published in journals.

This project aims to map relations and mutual influence in online science communities. Psychology and neuroscience communities are especially interesting. These fields are accompanied by transient changes, due to replication crisis, open science movement and  many methodological debates  and advances.

Is it possible to map the structure of the field and “hot” topics using mostly Twitter data? How the information about publications spreads? What define that the paper will become popular (apart from scientific merit)? These questions are relevant not only for disciplines such as sociology of science. Also, answers could inform those, who want to share their research with others in the most effective way. P

The project could use existing [dataset](<https://www.altmetric.com/blog/twitter-in-scholarly-communication/>). We will also download relevant data directly from Twitter to answer specific problems. Please remember that there are some limitations imposed on downloading data from the service. We will process and analyze data using open languages like R or Python. We could use Gephi for visualizations. Example analysis could involve simple graph-theoretical measures to map the relation between different sub-disciplines.

Further direction for the analysis will depend on participants and the availability of data. The project description soon will be accompanied by a small demo. Other ideas on how to analyze the public online presence of scientists are also welcome.
